Once it was mostly installed, did some dirty hacks.
* Point 12 from https://davidwpearson.wordpress.com/2017/01/12/installing-nvidias-cuda-8-0-on-fedora-25/ (except the directory was /usr/local/cuda-8.0/include/crt/host_config.h). This is to all gcc 8 rather than just 6
* https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2/issues/1194#issuecomment-330668216 or https://xpra.org/trac/ticket/1600. Edit /usr/include/bits/floatn.h to get 128 bit floats
* restart

I was still getting warnings about MPI: `WARNING - No MPI compiler found.` Going to try get pytorch running without worrying about this
